	The great question certainly was, what? Alice looked all
	round her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but 
	she did not see anything that looked like the right thing 
	to eat or drink under the circumstances. There was a large 
	mushroom growing near her, about the same height as herself; 
	and when she had looked under it, and on both sides of it, and 
	behind it, it occurred to her that she might as well look and 
	see what was on the top of it.
	</p>
	<p>
	Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit 
	of stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy 
	jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of 
	delight, and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; 
	then Alice dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being 
	run over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy
	made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in 
	its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice.
	</p>
	<p>
	Thinking it was very 
	like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting 
	every moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the 
	thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short charges 
	at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time and 
	a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at 
	last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue 
	hanging out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.
