	<h3>Alice in Wonderland</h3>
	So she called softly after it, 
	“Mouse dear! Do come back again, and 
	we won’t talk about cats or dogs either, 
	if you don’t like them!” When the Mouse heard 
	this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: 
	its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice thought), 
	and it said in a low trembling voice, “Let us get to 
	the shore, and then I’ll tell you my history, and you’ll 
	understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.”

It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite 
crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it: 
there were a Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several 
other curious creatures. Alice led the way, and the whole party 
swam to the shore.

	<h3>Sherlock Holmes</h3>
I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where 
I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in 
my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and 
generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, 
spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an 
instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one 
side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed 
on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in 
which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought 
of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there 
had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman 
absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, 
and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to 
sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride 
gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch chain 
in memory of the occasion.
