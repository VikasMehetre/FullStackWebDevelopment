	A professional case of great gravity was engaging my own attention at the time,
	and the whole of next day I was busy at the bedside of the sufferer. 
	It was not until close upon six o’clock that I found myself free and was 
	able to spring into a hansom and drive to Baker Street, half afraid that I 
	might be too late to assist at the dénouement of the little mystery. 
	I found Sherlock Holmes alone, however, half asleep, with his long, 
	thin form curled up in the recesses of his armchair. 
	A formidable array of bottles and test-tubes, with the pungent 
	cleanly smell of hydrochloric acid, told me that he had spent his 
	day in the chemical work which was so dear to him.

Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of stick, 
and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped into the 
air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight, and rushed at 
the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice dodged behind a 
great thistle, to keep herself from being run over; and the moment 
she appeared on the other side, the puppy made another rush at the 
stick, and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it; 
then Alice, thinking it was very like having a game of play with a 
cart-horse, and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet, 
ran round the thistle again; then the puppy began a series of short 
charges at the stick, running a very little way forwards each time 
and a long way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at 
last it sat down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging 
out of its mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape; 
so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out 
of breath, and till the puppy’s bark sounded quite faint in the distance.

	The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their 
	throne when they arrived, with a great crowd assembled 
	about them—all sorts of little birds and beasts, 
	as well as the whole pack of cards: the Knave was 
	standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on 
	each side to guard him; and near the King was the 
	White Rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll 
	of parchment in the other. In the very middle of the 
	court was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: 
	they looked so good, that it made Alice quite hungry to 
	look at them—“I wish they’d get the trial done,” she thought, 
	“and hand round the refreshments!” But there seemed to be no 
	chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her,
	to pass away the time.
